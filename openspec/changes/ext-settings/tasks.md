## 1. Schema and store

- [ ] 1.1 Create `src/settings/schema.ts` with the `SETTINGS` table (key, scope, default, validator) and the derived `SettingsValues` type for every entry in the spec
  - Defaults match the spec: timeout 15 minutes, action Lock, clipboard Never, theme System default, autofill on page load off
  - Each validator returns the default for an unknown or malformed value
- [ ] 1.2 Create `src/settings/store.ts` reading and writing `settings:<accountId>` and `settings:global` in `storage.local`, patching rather than replacing, and deleting the account record on account removal
- [ ] 1.3 Create `src/settings/policy.ts` with `TimeoutPolicy`, `NO_POLICY` and `applyPolicy` clamping the timeout and forcing the action without rewriting the stored value

## 2. Messages and background

- [ ] 2.1 Add `settings.get`, `settings.set`, `settings.server.set`, `pin.enable`, `pin.disable`, `pin.unlock`, `about.get` and the `SettingsSnapshot`, `ServerSettings`, `PinUnlockResult`, `AboutInfo` types to `src/messages.ts`
- [ ] 2.2 Handle the new kinds in `entrypoints/background.ts` and feed the ADR-002 timeout config from the store through `applyPolicy` on every read
  - Request/response arms return the Promise; nothing new is fire-and-forget
  - The clipboard clear delay is read by ext-vault-browse through the same snapshot

## 3. PIN unlock

- [ ] 3.1 Create `src/settings/pin.ts`: PBKDF2-SHA256 600 000 iterations with a random 16-byte salt, AES-256-GCM wrap of the PKCS#8 bytes, envelope codec, and a placement helper choosing `storage.session`, `storage.local` or the Firefox memory fallback
- [ ] 3.2 Implement `pin.enable`, `pin.disable` and `pin.unlock` in the background with the attempt counter stored beside the blob, purge of blob and counter on lock, timeout, logout, account removal, suite change and the fifth wrong PIN
- [ ] 3.3 Add the PIN field and "Use master password" link to the unlock view from ext-accounts-and-unlock, shown only when the snapshot reports a PIN, with the "PIN disabled after too many attempts" state

## 4. Server-mirrored preferences

- [ ] 4.1 Create `src/settings/server-mirror.ts` for `GET/PUT /api/settings/user`: string encoding of toggles, cache with `fetchedAt` in the account record, stale computation, refresh at the end of the ext-vault-browse sync and on Sync now, online-only writes that store the echoed set

## 5. Popup views

- [ ] 5.1 Create `entrypoints/popup/views/settings/index.ts` with the six-section list, per-section navigation and back control, wired into the Settings tab of the popup shell
- [ ] 5.2 Create `account-security.ts`: timeout options with Custom entry and policy-aware hiding, Never warning with confirmation, action with Log out note, Lock now, Log out with confirmation, PIN toggle and dialog, biometrics disabled, Change master password link, `session_timeout` shown read-only as "Web app default"
- [ ] 5.3 Create `autofill.ts`: the five entries with their warnings and notes, the inline-menu "Coming later" state from `capabilities.inlineMenu`, shortcut display from `browser.commands.getAll()` with the Chromium link and the Firefox instructions, clear clipboard options
- [ ] 5.4 Create `notifications.ts`: Ask to add, Ask to update, Excluded domains with Add current site via `activeTab`, free-text add, duplicate and empty rejection, remove; the Keepiq server notifications subsection with stale indicator, disabled-offline and revert-on-error behaviour
- [ ] 5.5 Create `vault.ts`: Sync now with Last sync and the offline failure message, Folders entry opening the ext-vault-edit folder manager, Import and Export links to the web app, Default item type from cached types with the `login` fallback and note
- [ ] 5.6 Create `appearance.ts` and extend `entrypoints/popup/popup.css`: theme applied via `data-theme` before first paint, compact mode tokens, show animations class, quick copy actions toggle, read-only Language line
- [ ] 5.7 Create `about.ts`: version from the manifest, server origin, Help, Report a bug, Privacy policy, Keepiq web app links, Rate the extension hidden while the store constant is `<store-url>`

## 6. Verification

- [ ] 6.1 Add `vitest` with unit tests for schema validation fallbacks, `applyPolicy` clamping and a PIN wrap and unwrap round trip including a wrong-PIN failure
- [ ] 6.2 Run `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm run build` and `npm run build:firefox`, load `.output/chrome-mv3/` and `.output/firefox-mv2/` in both browsers and walk every settings view
  - Each toggle persists across popup close and reopen and takes effect without reloading the extension
  - PIN unlock works, the fifth wrong PIN reverts to master password, and the blob is gone after Lock now
  - Server toggles show the stale indicator with the network disabled and write when online
  - `grep -rn "chrome\." src/ entrypoints/` matches only comments
